# Diet app

****************************** Important ******************************

Please run the JAR file in the directory "prototype_java", and please don't move the JAR file anywhere else as it reads all the relevant data using a relative path. The JAR file should work as I have already put those libraries inside it. 

Just in case the JAR file doesn't work, the external libraries used are JFreeChart, Junit 5, and iText 7.

In the user_info folder, there's already one user with username test1 and the password is 12345678. You may test the program directly using this account if you wish, or you can directly register a new one.
